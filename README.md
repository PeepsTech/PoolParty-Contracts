## Aave Party 👻🏊🎉

Launching an Aave Party allows anyone to pool funds with friends and automatically convert such tribute to interest-bearing Aave Tokens (aTokens). Party members can see their pooled aToken balances grow in real-time. Earn together. Change the world.

`AaveParty.sol` is built on the Moloch DAO v2 smart contracts. Therefore, it is a permissioned DAO that requires tribute and a confirming vote by existing members to convert such tribute into aToken (occurring on `processProposal`).

Party members may also `ragequit` and liquidate their internal `shares` and `loot` balances into their fair share of aToken held in the DAO contract.

Aave Party may also be used to fund other projects with aToken. 

[WIP add 'collect earnings' conversion from aToken to reserve asset]
